curllog is a C++ wrapper around libcurl and the libxml2 HTML parser
for the purpose of facilitating scripting of web interactions and
optionally logging the results in useful formats.

Work with the Gnu Autotools has been a bit painful due to the fact that different versions are installed on the various systems I want to run on.

Currently:

ocs-fts:
  autoreconf -i fails, and libtool is out of date, so:
  Need to add a proper test for clock_gettime in -lrt

  lcl=/home/nallen/local
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$lcl/lib
  libtoolize --force
  aclocal
  autoheader
  automake --add-missing
  autoconf
  ./configure --prefix=$lcl CPPFLAGS=-I$lcl/include LDFLAGS='-L$lcl/lib -lrt'
  make

qnx6:
  libtool is out of date, so:

  autoreconf -i --force
  ./configure
  make

cygwin:
  cutting edge!:

  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make
