curllog is a C++ wrapper around libcurl and the libxml2 HTML parser
for the purpose of facilitating scripting of web interactions and
optionally logging the results in useful formats.

Work with the Gnu Autotools has been a bit painful due to the fact that different versions are installed on the various systems I want to run on.

Currently:

ocs-fts:
  autoreconf -i fails, and libtool is out of date, so:

  libtoolize --force
  aclocal
  autoheader
  automake --add-missing
  autoconf
  lcl=/home/nallen/local
  ./configure --prefix=$lcl CPPFLAGS=-I$lcl/include LDFLAGS=-L$lcl/lib
  make

qnx6:
  libtool is out of date, so:

  autoreconf -i --force
  ./configure
  make

cygwin:
  cutting edge!:

  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make
